That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers. (Larry Niven) Microsoft has a new version out, Windows XP, which according to everybody is the ‘most reliable Windows ever.’ To me, this is like saying that asparagus is ‘the most articulate vegetable ever.’ (Dave Barry) Software undergoes beta testing shortly before it’s released. Beta is Latin for “still doesn’t work”. (Anonymous) Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.
